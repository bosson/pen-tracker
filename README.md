# pen-tracker

Track a pen with your camera, project stub. 
I once had a linux box with pen (fujitsu lifebook, 9" with a pen). 
I that pen again, but for a large screen. I dont enjoy stylus... 
There are some new computers for this, like the dell canvas 27".

TODO: 
- Linux/Mac/Window input device registration
- Pen with three color-dots for tracking
- Tracking using basic hd web-cam 
- Use screen overlay grid to sync cam position. 
- Two cam support for stereoscopic
- Force feedback via BT or light
